Are you curious about South Korea? You might have heard of Korean dramas, Korean BBQ, and K-Pop, but may not know much about them. With the growing popularity of the South Korean culture, I'm here to talk about Korea. 

### THE EDITOR
The editor, Michelle Kim, is a Korean-American currently living in California. She enjoys immersing herself into her Korean culture and loves listening to K-Pop and watches K-dramas in her free time. With the current surge in interest in the Korean culture, Michelle hopes this website will be able to help others learn about Korea and overall share more about Korea and Korean culture.

### KOREAN TRADITIONS AND BELIEFS
Confucianism is the spiritual ground that has had the longest influence in Korea that have influenced many of the social and political philosophies of Korea today. The concept of hierarchy is very important in Korea, which stems from Confucian beliefs. The typical Korean hierarchy is set based on age, occupation, education level, and social class, which influences the emphasis on respecting elders and ancestors.

The traditional Korean family is a patrilocal stem family. The eldest son is expected to take on the responsibility of the family, such as taking care of the parents after retirement, and is also inherited the family estates. The family relationship is also part of a hierarchy, where the authority rests with the, traditionally male, head of the household. Due to the influence of Confucian values, the Korean woman's role in the household is restricted to the domestic duties.

One of Korea's biggest holidays is Lunar New Year's Day. Lunar New Year's Day occurs sometime in January or February where Koreans traditionally perform a ritual known as "세배" (sebae). This is when the entire family gathers in traditional Korean clothing called "한복" (hanbok), and performs a deep bow in respect while wishing for great luck for the new year.

Another very important holiday in Korea is Korean Thanksgiving, or 추석, chuseok. Korean Thanksgiving (추석, chuseok) occurs in September-October where an ancestral memorial rite known as 차례 (charye) is the most important part. The family gathers to have a large feast, similar to America's Thanksgiving, but the Korean Thanksgiving gives thanks to their ancestors. Both holidays are very important in Korea and have certain food dishes the family eats in honor of the holiday.

At the very heart of Korean cuisine is rice, seafood, and vegetables. Korea has had a long history of being a almost exclusively agricultural country, though it has changed recently. Fermented dishes are also an integral part of Korean cuisine, the most common being kimchi which a big staple in the Korean diet. Each meal always has a number of side dishes Koreans call "ban-chan", which almost always consists of some type of kimchi.

### KOREAN POPULAR CULTURE
Korean popular culture is known as "hallyu", which translates to "Korean wave". Korean popular culture is now popularized around the globe, and usually includes Korean pop music, dramas, and movies. 

#### K-POP

A large part of Korean popular culture is the Korean pop music, otherwise known as "K-Pop". Idol groups are the core of K-pop, where entertainment agencies recruit and train young trainees to hopefully debut as an artist in a group. Each group member has their assigned roles of being a leader, singer, dancer, rapper, visual, or some overlap of these roles. K-pop is essentially integrated content which includes, not just the music, but the elements of clothing, makeup, choreography, and visuals. K-pop music is largely influenced by trends in the Western mainstream music industry, with samples from rock, hip-hop, jazz, and more. 

#### KOREAN DRAMAS

Before K-Pop was at its peak, Korean dramas were what was popular globally. K-dramas range between a variety of genres––from historical to comedy to action, K-dramas cover everything in between. The most popular genre is romance, but it is quite different from the type of love stories we see on the screen in the West with less provocative scenes. Largely due to  heightened interest, many K-dramas have also started to become more progressive by tackling societal issues such as classism, bullying, mental health, and corruption.
