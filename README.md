### KOREAN TRADITIONS AND BELIEFS
Confucianism is the spiritual ground that has had the longest influence in Korea that have influenced many of the social and political philosophies of Korea today. The concept of hierarchy is very important in Korea, which stems from Confucian beliefs. The typical Korean hierarchy is set based on age, occupation, education level, and social class, which influences the emphasis on respecting elders and ancestors.

The traditional Korean family is a patrilocal stem family. The eldest son is expected to take on the responsibility of the family, such as taking care of the parents after retirement, and is also inherited the family estates. The family relationship is also part of a hierarchy, where the authority rests with the, traditionally male, head of the household. Due to the influence of Confucian values, the Korean woman's role in the household is restricted to the domestic duties.

Korea celebrates two major holidays: Lunar New Year's Day (설날, seollal) and Korean Thanksgiving (추석, chuseok). Lunar New Year's Day occurs sometime in January or February where Koreans traditionally perform a ritual known as "세배" (sebae). This is when the entire family gathers in traditional Korean clothing called "한복" (hanbok), and performs a deep bow in respect while wishing for great luck for the new year. Korean Thanksgiving (추석, chuseok) occurs in September-October where an ancestral memorial rite known as 차례 (charye) is the most important part. The family gathers to have a large feast, similar to America's Thanksgiving, but the Korean Thanksgiving gives thanks to their ancestors. Both holidays are very important in Korea and have certain food dishes the family eats in honor of the holiday.

### KOREAN CUISINE
At the very heart of Korean cuisine is rice, seafood, and vegetables. Korea has had a long history of being a almost exclusively agricultural country, though it has changed recently. Fermented dishes are also an integral part of Korean cuisine, the most common being kimchi which a big staple in the Korean diet. Each meal always has a number of side dishes Koreans call "ban-chan", which almost always consists of some type of kimchi.
