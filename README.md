# WELCOME, 
# SO LET'S TALK ABOUT KOREA!
Are you curious about Korea? You might have heard of Korean dramas, Korean BBQ, and K-Pop, but may not know much about them. With the growing popularity of the South Korean culture, I'm here to talk about Korea. 

### THE EDITOR

The editor, Michelle Kim, is a Korean-American currently living in California. She enjoys immersing herself into her Korean culture and loves listening to K-Pop and watches K-dramas in her free time. With the current surge in interest in the Korean culture, Michelle hopes this website will be able to get others to learn about Korea.
