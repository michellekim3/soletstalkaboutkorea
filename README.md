### KOREAN TRADITIONS AND BELIEFS
Confucianism is the spiritual ground that has had the longest influence in Korea that have influenced many of the social and political philosophies of Korea today. The concept of hierarchy is very important in Korea, which stems from Confucian beliefs. The typical Korean hierarchy is set based on age, occupation, education level, and social class, which influences the emphasis on respecting elders and ancestors.

The traditional Korean family is a patrilocal stem family. The eldest son is expected to take on the responsibility of the family, such as taking care of the parents after retirement, and is also inherited the family estates. The family relationship is also part of a hierarchy, where the authority rests with the, traditionally male, head of the household. Due to the influence of Confucian values, the Korean woman's role in the household is restricted to the domestic duties.
